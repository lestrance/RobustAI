## üìö Overview

This repository contains the **official MATLAB R2024b implementation** of our IEEE Access 2025 paper.  
We introduce two novel defence mechanisms against adversarial examples:

- ‚úÖ **Adversarial Awareness Score (AAS)** ‚Äì a scalar metric that detects adversarial inputs using robust Wavelet Scattering Network (WSN) features.
- ‚úÖ **AAS-guided Jacobian Regularisation** ‚Äì a dynamic model regularisation strategy that improves adversarial robustness without degrading clean performance.

All experiments are implemented in MATLAB R2024b and validated on subsets of the ImageNet dataset.

## üß™ Reproducing Experiments (Live Scripts)

We provide three MATLAB Live Scripts that reproduce the core experiments described in the paper. These scripts are self-contained and can be run interactively in MATLAB R2024b.

| Experiment | Description | Script |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **1** | Compare adversarial robustness of WSN and DNN features | `Experiment_01.mlx` |
| **2** | Calculate and evaluate the Adversarial Awareness Score (AAS) | `Experiment_02.mlx` |
| **3** | Retrain model with AAS-guided Jacobian Regularisation | `Experiment_03.mlx` |

> ‚úÖ Tested with **MATLAB R2024b**  
> üì¶ Required Toolboxes: *Deep Learning Toolbox*, *Wavelet Toolbox*, *Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox*
