## üìö Research Overview

This repository contains the **official MATLAB R2024b implementation** of our IEEE Access 2025 paper. We introduce two novel defence mechanisms against adversarial examples:

### Key Innovations

- ‚úÖ **Adversarial Awareness Score (AAS)** ‚Äì A scalar metric that detects adversarial inputs using robust Wavelet Scattering Network (WSN) features
- ‚úÖ **AAS-guided Jacobian Regularisation** ‚Äì A dynamic model regularisation strategy that improves adversarial robustness without degrading clean performance

### Core Methodology
```
AAS_F = ||f_DNN(x)||_F / ‚àödim(f_DNN) / ||f_WSN(x)||_F / ‚àödim(f_WSN)
```

The method leverages the mathematical property that WSN features maintain remarkable stability under adversarial perturbations while DNN features exhibit substantial vulnerability, creating a reliable detection mechanism.

All experiments are implemented in MATLAB R2024b and validated on subsets of the ImageNet dataset.

## üìä Demonstration Results

Our method provides a clear visual distinction between clean and adversarial examples through a comprehensive analysis pipeline:

*Figure 2: AAS analysis of an adversarial example showing high adversarial likelihood (Adversarial classification) with significantly elevated feature norm ratios.*

### Key Observations:
