## 📚 Overview

This repository contains the **official MATLAB R2024b implementation** of our IEEE Access 2025 paper.  
We introduce two novel defence mechanisms against adversarial examples:

- ✅ **Adversarial Awareness Score (AAS)** – a scalar metric that detects adversarial inputs using robust Wavelet Scattering Network (WSN) features.
- ✅ **AAS-guided Jacobian Regularisation** – a dynamic model regularisation strategy that improves adversarial robustness without degrading clean performance.

All experiments are implemented in MATLAB R2024b and validated on subsets of the ImageNet dataset.

## 🧪 Reproducing Experiments (Live Scripts)

We provide three MATLAB Live Scripts corresponding to the three main experiments in the paper:

| Experiment | Description | Script |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **1** | Validate robustness of hand-crafted features vs DNN | `Experiment1_FeatureRobustness.mlx` |
| **2** | Compute and evaluate Adversarial Awareness Score (AAS) | `Experiment2_AASDetection.mlx` |
| **3** | Train with AAS-guided Jacobian Regularisation | `Experiment3_AAS_JacobianTraining.mlx` |

> 🧭 All scripts tested with **MATLAB R2024b**  
> 🧰 Required toolboxes: *Deep Learning Toolbox, Wavelet Toolbox, Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox*

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/lestrance/RobustAI.git
    cd RobustAI
    ```

2. Launch MATLAB R2024b and set the working directory:
    ```matlab
    run('code/config/params.m'); % Sets up paths and global parameters
    ```

3. Run the Live Scripts in `notebooks/` to reproduce results.
